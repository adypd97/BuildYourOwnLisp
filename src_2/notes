re-write rules are just repeat structures in a language. Explained here with an example:
	1. In natural language: we can say "a cat is looking at me". But we can also say "a cat and dog are looking at me"
	   what happened here is that, because the language is recursive, we can add as many nouns as possible while still
	   maintaining the 'rules' of the language. 
	2. In programming language too we see similar repeat, recursive substructures which still follow the rule but
	   can very well be constructed. Ex an if statement, which in turn could have an if statement and so on.

So, there are possibly infinite things that can be written in a language of this kind. But with the re-write rules we 
only need a finite set of steps to interpret them, which is the key insight of Chomsky.

A GRAMMAR in the Chomsky description is a SET OF RE-WRITE RULES that can be used to process/interpret possibly
infinite set of statements in a language.

To understand a language we need to build a grammar that describes that language. A set of re-write rules in other words 
that will allow us to interpret all the things that can be said in that language.

mpc
	mpc is the library that will build this grammar, create an internal representation, evaluate the things that we write
	in the language.
	
	mpc is a Parser Combinator library, that allows to build parsers that are programs that understand particular
	languages.


What could code that looks like 'grammar' look like ?
	Suppose we use mpc to recognize a language called Shiba Inu (Doge), then the rules look like so

	an Adjective is either 'wow', 'many', 'so', and 'such'
	a Noun is either 'lisp', 'language', 'c', 'book' and 'build'
	a Phrase is and Adjective followed by a Noun
	A Doge is a zero or More Phrases
